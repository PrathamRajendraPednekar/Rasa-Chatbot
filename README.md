- This is the simplest way of making a chatbot without coding, by using framework like, "RASA".
- After the chatbot is created you can add your Q&A also if u want.
- The folder is which i have uploaded(chatbot) is created by using the steps which i have written in word file.

#IMP
- In the chatbot folder , there is also a folder which i have not uploaded beacuse the folder is not getting uploaded , so the folder name is ".rasa".
- But when you will go through this steps which i have written in word file, the ".rasa" folder will generate automatically .
